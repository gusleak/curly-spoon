        <p class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've just got a vinyl player a couple of months ago, so picked up this hobby pretty recently. But it was something that I was planning for a long time. This is to get your hopes down in case you were
        expecting any pro information xD.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turntable I use is an <b>Audio-Techncica ATLP60X</b>, which is reputed as a good choice for beginners.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I've been quickly expanding my vinyl collection. You can check it out <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/gusleak/collection">here</a>. To get vinyls I often use Discogs, a website where members can buy and sell vinyls between each other. It has a great selection of vinyls. Check for yourself by searching for something in the form below.
